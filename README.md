# NgxPostGrid

### Build and run project

```
$ npm i
$ npm start 
```
Open browser and visit http://localhost:4200/

### Decisions

* I choose to fire click even from `app component` instead of using even emitter from `post component`. Just to keep things simpler. 


### Shared State with RxJS

The RxJS shared state version is available in the `rxjs-shared-state` branch.
